# 🚀 Building Google Photos Takeout Helper on Windows

This guide shows you how to build and run both CLI and GUI versions locally on Windows, including resource requirements.

## 📋 Prerequisites

### For CLI Version (Lightweight)
- **Dart SDK** (≥3.5.0): Download from https://dart.dev/get-dart
- **Storage**: ~200 MB for Dart SDK

### For GUI Version (Full Experience)
- **Flutter SDK** (≥3.24.0): Download from https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows
- **Visual Studio Build Tools** (for Windows desktop support)
- **Storage**: ~1.5 GB for Flutter SDK + build tools

## ⚡ CLI Version (Recommended for Performance)

### Quick Start
```cmd
# 1. Navigate to project directory
cd C:\Users\HP\Desktop\Code\GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper

# 2. Copy CLI dependencies
copy pubspec_cli.yaml pubspec.yaml

# 3. Get dependencies
dart pub get

# 4. Run directly (no build needed)
dart run bin/gpth_refactored.dart --help

# Example usage
dart run bin/gpth_refactored.dart --input "C:\path\to\takeout" --output "C:\path\to\organized"
```

### Build Standalone Executable
```cmd
# Create optimized executable
dart compile exe bin/gpth_refactored.dart -o gpth-cli.exe

# Run the executable
gpth-cli.exe --input "C:\path\to\takeout" --output "C:\path\to\organized"
```

### CLI Resource Usage
- **RAM**: 50-200 MB during processing
- **CPU**: Low-moderate (scales with file count)
- **Executable Size**: ~10-15 MB
- **Startup Time**: <1 second

## 🎨 GUI Version (Rich User Interface)

### Setup
```cmd
# 1. Navigate to project directory  
cd C:\Users\HP\Desktop\Code\GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper

# 2. Ensure Flutter dependencies (default pubspec.yaml)
flutter pub get

# 3. Enable Windows desktop support
flutter config --enable-windows-desktop

# 4. Verify setup
flutter doctor
```

### Development Mode
```cmd
# Run in development mode with hot reload
flutter run -d windows lib/gui/main.dart
```

### Build Release Application
```cmd
# Build optimized release version
flutter build windows --release

# Executable will be created at:
# build\windows\x64\runner\Release\gpth.exe
```

### GUI Resource Usage
- **RAM**: 150-400 MB during processing
- **CPU**: Moderate (UI rendering + processing)
- **Executable Size**: ~25-30 MB
- **Startup Time**: 2-3 seconds

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Aspect | CLI Version | GUI Version |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Memory Usage** | 50-200 MB | 150-400 MB |
| **Disk Space** | 10-15 MB | 25-30 MB |
| **Startup Time** | <1 second | 2-3 seconds |
| **CPU Usage** | Low | Moderate |
| **Dependencies** | Dart only | Flutter + VS Build Tools |
| **Installation Size** | ~200 MB | ~1.5 GB |

## 🎯 Which Version Should You Choose?

### Choose CLI if:
✅ You want minimal resource usage  
✅ You prefer command-line interfaces  
✅ You're processing large datasets  
✅ You want fastest performance  
✅ You're comfortable with command parameters  

### Choose GUI if:
✅ You prefer visual interfaces  
✅ You want real-time progress tracking  
✅ You need interactive file/folder selection  
✅ You want comprehensive result visualization  
✅ You prefer point-and-click operations  

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### CLI Issues
```cmd
# If dependencies fail
dart pub cache repair
dart pub get

# If compilation fails
dart --version  # Ensure Dart ≥3.5.0
```

### GUI Issues
```cmd
# If Flutter setup fails
flutter doctor --verbose
flutter config --enable-windows-desktop

# If build fails
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build windows --verbose
```

## 💡 Optimization Tips

### CLI Optimization
```cmd
# Build with specific optimizations
dart compile exe bin/gpth_refactored.dart -o gpth-optimized.exe --target-os windows

# Use performance flags if processing large datasets
gpth-cli.exe --input "path" --output "path" --max-threads 4 --skip-validation
```

### GUI Optimization
```cmd
# Build highly optimized release
flutter build windows --release --dart-define=FLUTTER_WEB_USE_SKIA=true

# Run with performance profiling
flutter run --profile -d windows lib/gui/main.dart
```

## 📁 Example Folder Structure After Build

```
GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper/
├── gpth-cli.exe                     # CLI executable
├── build/windows/x64/runner/Release/
│   ├── gpth.exe                     # GUI executable
│   ├── data/                        # GUI assets
│   └── *.dll                        # Required libraries
└── ...
```

## 🚀 Quick Commands Summary

**CLI - Fastest Setup:**
```cmd
dart pub get && dart run bin/gpth_refactored.dart --help
```

**GUI - Rich Experience:**
```cmd
flutter pub get && flutter run -d windows lib/gui/main.dart
```

Both versions are designed to be resource-efficient and work well on modern Windows machines without causing performance issues.
