# AI Context for Google Photos Takeout Helper (GPTH)

## Critical User Expectations and Data Safety

**⚠️ PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE: NO UNEXPECTED DATA LOSS**

This tool handles irreplaceable personal memories (photos, videos). Every behavior must be **predictable**, **documented**, and **safe**. Users must always know exactly what will happen to their data before any operation begins.

### Core Safety Principles
1. **Predictable Behavior**: Every flag combination must have well-defined, documented behavior
2. **No Surprises**: Users should never lose data unexpectedly or find files in unexpected locations
3. **Reversible Operations**: When possible, operations should be reversible (e.g., shortcuts vs copies)
4. **Clear Communication**: Always explain what will happen before it happens
5. **Graceful Failures**: Failures should be informative and never leave data in corrupted state

### Data Safety Guarantees
- **File Movement**: Files are moved from input to output directory with metadata processing and enhancement
- **Duplicate Removal Safety**: Duplicate detection uses SHA-256 content hashing for accuracy. Duplicate removal moves (not deletes) files, so originals are relocated and duplicates stay in the input folder and are not lost.
- **Atomic Operations**: Each processing step either completes fully or rolls back cleanly
- **Validation**: File integrity is verified using content hashing before any destructive operations
- **Backup Recommendations**: Tool should encourage users to backup originals before processing
- **Clear Output Structure**: Output organization must be immediately understandable to users

### User Experience Expectations
- **Progress Visibility**: Long operations show clear progress indicators
- **Meaningful Errors**: Error messages explain the problem and suggest solutions
- **Dry Run Capability**: Users can preview operations without executing them
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs available for troubleshooting and verification
- **Interactive Guidance**: Interactive mode guides users through complex decisions

## Project Overview
GPTH is a command-line tool written in Dart that transforms chaotic Google Photos Takeout exports into organized photo libraries. It processes ZIP files from Google Takeout and reorganizes media files with proper dates, album structures, and metadata.

**Version**: 4.1.0-Xentraxx
**Language**: Dart (CLI application, not Flutter)  
**Platform**: Cross-platform with Windows-specific features

## Core Functionality
- Extracts and processes Google Takeout ZIP files automatically
- Organizes photos chronologically with correct timestamps
- Restores album structure with multiple handling strategies
- Fixes metadata from JSON files and EXIF data
- Removes duplicates using content hashing
- Writes GPS coordinates and timestamps back to media files
- Handles special formats (HEIC, Motion Photos, RAW formats)
- Fixes file extension mismatches

## Architecture

### Main Components
- **`bin/gpth.dart`**: Entry point with CLI argument parsing
- **`lib/domain/main_pipeline.dart`**: Core processing pipeline with 8 sequential steps
- **`lib/domain/steps/`**: Individual processing steps (step_01 through step_08)
- **`lib/domain/services/`**: Business logic services
- **`lib/infrastructure/`**: External service integrations (ExifTool, platform-specific)
- **`lib/presentation/`**: User interaction and display logic

### Processing Pipeline (8 Sequential Steps)
1. **Fix Extensions**: Correct mismatched file extensions
2. **Discover Media**: Find and classify all media files
3. **Remove Duplicates**: Eliminate duplicates using SHA-256 content hashing. Duplicate files are moved (not deleted) to consolidate identical content while preserving input directory integrity
4. **Extract Dates**: Determine timestamps from JSON, EXIF, filenames
5. **Write EXIF**: Embed metadata (requires ExifTool for non-JPEG)
6. **Find Albums**: Detect and merge album relationships
7. **Move Files**: Organize to output structure with album behavior
8. **Update Creation Time**: Sync file timestamps (Windows only)

### Key Domain Models
- **`MediaEntity`**: Core representation of media files with metadata
- **`ProcessingConfig`**: Configuration for pipeline execution
- **`ProcessingResult`**: Comprehensive results with timing and statistics
- **`MediaEntityCollection`**: Collection of media entities with operations

## Coding Conventions

## Configuration Flags and Strategies

### Album Handling Strategies (`--albums`)
- **`shortcut` (default)**: Creates album folders with symlinks to original photos. Space-efficient but may not be portable across systems
- **`duplicate-copy`**: Creates album folders with actual photo copies. Portable but uses significantly more disk space
- **`json`**: Places all photos (including Archive/Trash) in one folder with JSON metadata file. Useful for programmatic access
- **`nothing`**: Ignores albums, organizes only by date. WARNING: Skips Archive/Trash photos
- **`reverse-shortcut`**: Album folders contain originals, "ALL_PHOTOS" folder has symlinks to albums. Duplicates photos across multiple albums

### Date Division Levels (`--divide-to-dates`)
- **`0` (none)**: No date-based folder organization
- **`1` (year)**: Organize into yearly folders (e.g., `2023/`, `2024/`)
- **`2` (month)**: Organize into monthly folders (e.g., `2023/01/`, `2023/02/`)
- **`3` (day)**: Organize into daily folders (e.g., `2023/01/15/`, `2023/01/16/`)

### Extension Fixing Modes (`--fix-extensions`)
- **`none`**: No extension fixing
- **`standard` (default)**: Fix extensions but skip TIFF-based files (protects RAW formats)
- **`conservative`**: Fix extensions but skip both TIFF and JPEG files (safest option)
- **`solo`**: Fix extensions then exit immediately (special diagnostic mode)

### Date Extraction Strategy (Priority Order)
1. **JSON metadata** (highest accuracy): From Google Photos' `.json` files
2. **EXIF data**: From image file metadata
3. **Filename guessing** (optional): Pattern matching from filenames
4. **JSON tryhard**: Fallback JSON parsing with relaxed validation
5. **Folder year**: Extract year from parent folder names like "Photos from YYYY"

### Processing Flags
- **`--write-exif` (default: true)**: Write GPS and DateTime to EXIF metadata (requires ExifTool for non-JPEG)
- **`--skip-extras`**: Skip extra images like `-edited` versions
- **`--guess-from-name` (default: true)**: Enable filename-based date guessing
- **`--transform-pixel-mp`**: Convert Google Pixel `.MP/.MV` files to `.mp4`
- **`--update-creation-time`**: Set file creation time to match photo date (Windows only)
- **`--limit-filesize`**: Enforce 64MB file size limit for low-RAM systems
- **`--verbose`**: Enable detailed logging output

### Interactive Mode
- Automatically enabled when no CLI arguments provided
- Guides users through setup process
- Provides step-by-step configuration with explanations

### Strategy Selection Logic
- Extension fixing runs first and can be configured to exit early (`solo` mode)
- Date extraction uses cascading fallback: JSON → EXIF → filename → JSON tryhard
- Album detection merges relationships between duplicate files before moving
- Duplicate detection uses SHA-256 content hashing for accuracy
- Moving strategy depends on album behavior and date division levels

## Comprehensive Flag Behavior and Combinations

### Album Handling Strategy (`--albums`) - Detailed Behavior

#### `shortcut` (Default Strategy)
**Behavior**: Creates symbolic links in album folders pointing to files in date-organized structure.
- **Output Structure** (example with `--divide-to-dates 0`):
  ```
  output/
  ├── ALL_PHOTOS/
  │   ├── IMG_001.jpg (original file)
  │   ├── IMG_002.mp4 (original file)
  │   └── IMG_003.jpg (original file)
  ├── ALBUMS/
  │   ├── Vacation 2023/
  │   │   ├── IMG_001.jpg -> ../../ALL_PHOTOS/IMG_001.jpg
  │   │   └── IMG_002.mp4 -> ../../ALL_PHOTOS/IMG_002.mp4
  │   └── Birthday Party/
  │       └── IMG_003.jpg -> ../../ALL_PHOTOS/IMG_003.jpg
  └── ARCHIVE/ (if archive photos exist)
  ```
- **Disk Usage**: Minimal (only one copy of each file)
- **Portability**: Limited (shortcuts may not work on different filesystems)
- **Archive/Trash Handling**: Archive and trash photos placed in date structure and linked from ARCHIVE/ folder
- **Duplicate Album Files**: Multiple albums containing same photo will have shortcuts to same original file

#### `duplicate-copy` Strategy
**Behavior**: Creates actual copies of files in each album folder where they belong.
- **Output Structure** (example with `--divide-to-dates 1`):
  ```
  output/
  ├── ALL_PHOTOS/
  │   ├── 2023/
  │   │   ├── IMG_001.jpg (original)
  │   │   └── IMG_002.mp4 (original)
  │   └── 2024/
  │       └── IMG_003.jpg (original)
  ├── ALBUMS/
  │   ├── Vacation 2023/
  │   │   ├── IMG_001.jpg (physical copy)
  │   │   └── IMG_002.mp4 (physical copy)
  │   └── Birthday Party/
  │       └── IMG_001.jpg (another physical copy)
  └── ARCHIVE/
  ```
- **Disk Usage**: High (multiple copies of files that appear in multiple albums)
- **Portability**: Excellent (works on any filesystem)
- **Archive/Trash Handling**: Archive and trash photos copied to both date structure and ARCHIVE/ folder
- **Duplicate Album Files**: Same photo appears as separate physical files in each album

#### `json` Strategy
**Behavior**: Places all photos in date structure (based on `--divide-to-dates` setting) with comprehensive JSON metadata file.
- **Output Structure** (example with `--divide-to-dates 3`):
  ```
  output/
  ├── ALL_PHOTOS/
  │   ├── 2023/01/15/
  │   │   ├── IMG_001.jpg
  │   │   └── IMG_002.mp4
  │   └── 2023/01/16/
  ├── metadata.json (contains all album and metadata information)
  └── ARCHIVE/ (contains archive/trash photos in date structure)
  ```
- **Disk Usage**: Minimal (one copy per file)
- **Portability**: Excellent (JSON is universal format)
- **Archive/Trash Handling**: All photos (including archive/trash) included in output with proper metadata flags
- **Album Information**: Stored in JSON file with file paths and album relationships

#### `nothing` Strategy
**Behavior**: Organizes photos only by date, completely ignoring album information.
- **Output Structure** (example with `--divide-to-dates 0`):
  ```
  output/
  └── ALL_PHOTOS/
      ├── IMG_001.jpg
      ├── IMG_002.mp4
      └── IMG_003.jpg
  ```
- **⚠️ WARNING**: Archive and trash photos are **COMPLETELY SKIPPED** and not included in output
- **Disk Usage**: Minimal (one copy per non-archive file)
- **Data Loss Risk**: Archive/trash photos are lost unless user specifically wants this behavior
- **Use Case**: When user only wants non-archived photos in simple date structure

#### `reverse-shortcut` Strategy
**Behavior**: Album folders contain original files, ALL_PHOTOS contains shortcuts back to albums.
- **Output Structure** (example with `--divide-to-dates 1`):
  ```
  output/
  ├── ALL_PHOTOS/
  │   ├── 2023/
  │   │   ├── IMG_001.jpg -> ../../ALBUMS/Vacation 2023/IMG_001.jpg
  │   │   └── IMG_002.mp4 -> ../../ALBUMS/Vacation 2023/IMG_002.mp4
  │   └── 2024/
  │       └── IMG_003.jpg -> ../../ALBUMS/Birthday Party/IMG_003.jpg
  ├── ALBUMS/
  │   ├── Vacation 2023/
  │   │   ├── IMG_001.jpg (original file)
  │   │   └── IMG_002.mp4 (original file)
  │   └── Birthday Party/
  │       └── IMG_003.jpg (original file)
  └── ARCHIVE/
  ```
- **Duplicate Handling**: Photos appearing in multiple albums are physically duplicated across album folders. For example, if IMG_001.jpg appears in both "Vacation 2023" and "Family Photos" albums, the original file will be stored in one album folder (e.g., "Vacation 2023") and a complete copy will be created in the other album folder ("Family Photos"). This means the same photo exists as separate physical files in each album it belongs to, significantly increasing disk usage but ensuring each album is self-contained.
- **Disk Usage**: Medium to high (duplicates files across multiple albums)
- **Use Case**: When album organization is more important than date organization

### Date Division Levels (`--divide-to-dates`) - Detailed Behavior

#### Level 0 (No Date Division)
**Behavior**: All photos placed in single folder regardless of date.
- **Structure**: `output/ALL_PHOTOS/` (flat structure)
- **File Naming**: Original names preserved with conflict resolution
- **Use Case**: Small collections or when date organization is not desired
- **Performance**: Fastest processing, may be slow to browse with many files

#### Level 1 (Year Division)
**Behavior**: Photos organized into yearly folders.
- **Structure**: `output/ALL_PHOTOS/2023/`, `output/ALL_PHOTOS/2024/`
- **Folder Names**: `YYYY` format (e.g., `2023`, `2024`)
- **Edge Cases**: Photos without dates placed in `UNKNOWN_DATE/` folder
- **Use Case**: Large collections spanning multiple years

#### Level 2 (Month Division)
**Behavior**: Photos organized into monthly folders within years.
- **Structure**: `output/ALL_PHOTOS/2023/01/`, `output/ALL_PHOTOS/2023/02/`
- **Folder Names**: `YYYY/MM` format with zero-padding
- **Fallback**: If month cannot be determined, placed in `YYYY/UNKNOWN_MONTH/`
- **Use Case**: Most common choice for balanced organization

#### Level 3 (Day Division)
**Behavior**: Photos organized into daily folders within months.
- **Structure**: `output/ALL_PHOTOS/2023/01/15/`, `output/ALL_PHOTOS/2023/01/16/`
- **Folder Names**: `YYYY/MM/DD` format with zero-padding
- **Fallback**: If day cannot be determined, placed in `YYYY/MM/UNKNOWN_DAY/`
- **Use Case**: Photographers with daily shooting or very large collections

### Extension Fixing Modes (`--fix-extensions`) - Detailed Behavior

#### `none` Mode
**Behavior**: No extension fixing performed.
- **Risk**: Files may have incorrect extensions making them unopenable
- **Use Case**: When file extensions are already correct or user wants to handle manually
- **Performance**: Fastest (skips extension analysis)

#### `standard` Mode (Default)
**Behavior**: Fixes extensions but protects TIFF-based files (including RAW formats).
- **Protected Types**: `.CR2`, `.NEF`, `.ARW`, `.DNG`, `.TIFF`, `.TIF`
- **Fixed Types**: Common formats like JPEG (fixes `.jpeg` vs `.jpg`), PNG, MP4, etc.
- **Safety**: Prevents corruption of complex RAW file formats
- **Use Case**: Recommended for most users with mixed file types

#### `conservative` Mode
**Behavior**: Fixes extensions but protects both TIFF-based and JPEG files.
- **Protected Types**: All TIFF formats plus `.JPG`, `.JPEG`
- **Fixed Types**: Only non-image formats and clearly safe image formats
- **Safety**: Maximum protection against metadata loss in JPEG files
- **Use Case**: When preserving original JPEG metadata is critical

#### `solo` Mode
**Behavior**: Performs extension fixing then immediately exits.
- **Use Case**: Diagnostic mode to see what extensions would be changed
- **Output**: Reports on extension changes without performing other processing
- **Safety**: Allows users to verify extension changes before full processing

### Critical Flag Combinations and Their Behaviors

#### Album Strategy + Date Division Combinations

**`--albums shortcut --divide-to-dates 2`** (Most Common)
- Creates date-organized originals with album shortcuts
- Balanced disk usage and organization
- Easy to browse both by date and by album

**`--albums duplicate-copy --divide-to-dates 0`**
- All photos in flat structure within albums
- High disk usage but maximum portability
- Good for final organization when space isn't a concern

**`--albums nothing --divide-to-dates 3`**
- ⚠️ **DATA LOSS**: Archive/trash photos completely excluded
- Very detailed date organization
- Only use when archive photos are definitely not wanted

**`--albums json --divide-to-dates 1`**
- Yearly organization with complete metadata preservation
- Programmatic access to album information
- Good for large collections needing metadata queries

#### Album Strategy Benefits

**`--albums duplicate-copy`**
- Album photos are copied to album folders (creates real copies)
- Higher disk usage due to album copies
- Recommended for organized album access

**`--albums shortcut`**
- Albums use shortcuts to date-organized files
- More efficient disk usage
- Good balance of organization and efficiency

**`--albums nothing`**
- Moves files from takeout to date structure only
- ⚠️ **RISK**: Archive/trash photos are lost

#### Duplicate Removal Behavior

**File Processing**
- Files are moved from takeout to output structure
- When duplicates detected, files are consolidated (moved, not deleted)
- First occurrence keeps its intended location
- Subsequent duplicates moved to first occurrence's location
- No files are lost, but takeout structure is modified

**Duplicate Detection Process**
1. SHA-256 hash calculated for each file's content
2. Files with identical hashes considered duplicates
3. Metadata (timestamps, GPS) preserved from best available source
4. Album relationships merged across all duplicate instances
5. File with best metadata/naming becomes the "canonical" version

#### Extension Fixing + Write EXIF Combinations

**`--fix-extensions solo`**
- Only fixes extensions, then exits
- No EXIF writing performed
- Diagnostic mode for extension issues

**`--fix-extensions conservative --write-exif false`**
- Minimal file modifications
- Preserves all original metadata
- Safest option for valuable originals

**`--fix-extensions standard --write-exif true --update-creation-time`** (Default)
- Comprehensive metadata correction
- Updates file timestamps to match photo dates
- Best user experience on Windows systems

### Dangerous Flag Combinations (Require User Confirmation)

1. **`--albums nothing`** (any other flags)   - ⚠️ Archive/trash photos will be lost
   - Must warn user explicitly

2. **Destructive operations without backup**
   - Original takeout structure will be modified
   - Should recommend creating backups for irreplaceable photos

3. **`--divide-to-dates 0 --albums nothing`**
   - All photos in single flat folder
   - May be overwhelming for large collections

4. **`--fix-extensions solo`** with other processing flags
   - Other processing will be skipped
   - User may expect full processing

### Interactive Mode Behavior

When no arguments provided, interactive mode should:
1. **Assess Input**: Analyze takeout structure and recommend appropriate settings
2. **Explain Risks**: Clearly explain any potential data loss scenarios
3. **Suggest Combinations**: Recommend flag combinations based on user needs
4. **Confirm Settings**: Show exactly what will happen before processing begins
5. **Provide Escape**: Allow user to exit safely at any point

### Error Handling and Recovery

- **Pre-flight Checks**: Validate all flag combinations before processing
- **Disk Space Verification**: Ensure sufficient space for chosen strategy
- **Permissions Check**: Verify write permissions for output directory
- **Graceful Degradation**: If ExifTool unavailable, continue with limited metadata writing
- **Progress Checkpoints**: Allow resumption of interrupted operations where possible
