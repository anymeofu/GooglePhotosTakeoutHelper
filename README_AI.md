### 🔧 Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between CLI, GUI, and core business logic
2. **Single Core API**: All interfaces use the same underlying API (`GpthCoreApi`)
3. **Processing Pipeline**: Maintains the original 8-step processing workflow
4. **State Management**: Riverpod for reactive GUI state management
5. **Material Design 3**: Modern UI with light/dark theme support

## 🚀 GUI Features

### Complete Flutter GUI Implementation
The GUI provides a modern, user-friendly interface with:

**Home Screen (`lib/gui/screens/home_screen.dart`)**:
- Directory selection with validation
- Configuration options (album behavior, date organization)
- Processing options (EXIF writing, skip extras, etc.)
- ExifTool status monitoring
- Space estimation and validation

**Processing Screen (`lib/gui/screens/processing_screen.dart`)**:
- Real-time progress tracking with animated indicators
- Step-by-step status updates
- Configuration summary display
- Error handling and retry options

**Results Screen (`lib/gui/screens/results_screen.dart`)**:
- Comprehensive processing statistics
- Performance metrics and timing data
- Success/error reporting
- Option to open output folder or process more files

**GUI Components**:
- Material Design 3 theming with support for light/dark modes
- Responsive layouts for different screen sizes
- Riverpod state management for reactive updates
- Smooth routing with go_router

### Usage Modes

**CLI Mode (Traditional)**:
```bash
dart run bin/gpth_refactored.dart --input /path/to/takeout --output /path/to/organized
```

**GUI Mode**:
```bash
# Requires Flutter SDK installed
flutter run -d windows/macos/linux lib/gui/main.dart
```

## 🎯 Future Development Phases

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (NEXT)
**Goal**: Ensure reliability and cross-platform compatibility
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Test GUI application with Flutter setup
- [ ] Add GUI integration tests
- [ ] Test cross-platform file operations
- [ ] Validate ExifTool integration on all platforms
- [ ] Performance testing with large datasets

### Phase 5: Documentation & Polish
**Goal**: Production-ready release
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Update main README.md with GUI instructions
- [ ] Create user guides for both CLI and GUI
- [ ] Add developer documentation
- [ ] Create installation guides

## 🔄 Processing Pipeline (8 Steps)

The core processing maintains the original 8-step pipeline:

1. **Fix Extensions** (`step_01_fix_extensions.dart`)
2. **Discover Media** (`step_02_discover_media.dart`) 
3. **Remove Duplicates** (`step_03_remove_duplicates.dart`)
4. **Extract Dates** (`step_04_extract_dates.dart`)
5. **Write EXIF** (`step_05_write_exif.dart`)
6. **Find Albums** (`step_06_find_albums.dart`)
7. **Move Files** (`step_07_move_files.dart`)
8. **Update Creation Time** (`step_08_update_creation_time.dart`)

Each step is independent, testable, and provides detailed progress reporting.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Language**: Dart 3.8+

## 🏗️ Build & Distribution Strategy

### Local Development
```bash
# CLI mode
dart run bin/gpth_refactored.dart

# GUI mode  
cd lib/gui && flutter run -d windows/macos/linux
```

### GitHub Actions Binary Compilation with Manual Triggers
The project supports automated and manual binary building via GitHub Actions:

**Workflow Features**:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/build.yml
name: Build Binaries
on:
  - push/pull_request (automatic)
  - workflow_dispatch (manual trigger)
jobs:
  build-cli: # CLI binaries for Windows, macOS, Linux
  build-gui: # GUI apps for Windows, macOS, Linux
  release: # Publish binaries to GitHub Releases
  test-compatibility: # Multi-version Dart testing
```

**Manual Trigger Options**:
- **Build Type**: 'all', 'cli-only', 'gui-only'
- **Platform Filter**: 'all', 'windows', 'macos', 'linux'
- **Release Creation**: Option to create pre-release with artifacts

**Binary Outputs**:
- CLI: Single executable per platform (`gpth-windows.exe`, `gpth-macos`, `gpth-linux`)
- GUI: Platform-specific packages (`.tar.gz`, `.zip`)
- Automatic release creation for tags, manual pre-releases for testing

### Manual Build Triggers

To manually trigger a build on GitHub:

1. **Navigate to Actions**: Go to the GitHub repository → Actions tab
2. **Select Workflow**: Click on "Build Binaries" workflow
3. **Run Workflow**: Click "Run workflow" button
4. **Configure Options**:
   - **Build Type**: Choose what to build
     - `all` - Build both CLI and GUI (default)
     - `cli-only` - Build only CLI binaries
     - `gui-only` - Build only GUI applications
   - **Platform**: Choose target platforms
     - `all` - Build for all platforms (default)
     - `windows` - Windows only
     - `macos` - macOS only
     - `linux` - Linux only
   - **Create Release**: Check to create a pre-release with artifacts

**Use Cases**:
- Test builds before tagging a release
- Build platform-specific binaries to save CI time
- Generate test builds for specific features
- Create pre-releases for beta testing

## 🔧 Development Commands

### Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
